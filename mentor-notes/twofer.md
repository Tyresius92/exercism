Hi!

Welcome to the JavaScript track on Exercism!

This is a really good first pass at the problem! I think we can make a small tweak and make it even better though!

When dealing with function parameters that may be undefined, JavaScript has the concept of [default values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Default_parameters) which could allow us to avoid the conditional statement. Do you see how we could use that here?
